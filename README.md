### Online Class Assistant(OCA)
Online Class Assistant can be used to connect teachers with the enrolled students of their assigned course. It establish communication between teacher & students of an assigned course. Teachers can announce notices (class postponed/ extra class/online class meeting link), share necessary resources related to assigned course using OCA. Enrolled students will be able to collect the information from OCA.

Using OCA teacher can easily keep in touch with their students. In this pandemic situation, almost all the classes are being conducted online. It is now more required for a student to connect with their respective teachers. Usually, we use social platforms (Facebook/Whatsapp) to communicate which is so weird for a formal institution. OCA will help to get rid of this communication problem.

Currently, this project is based on institution which has several courses running and teacher/instructor is assigned to a specific course. Later students/learners can enroll to the course using a particular course id/section id. More than one teacher can’t take a course in same section and a student can’t take a course in more than one section.

Main objective of this project is to keep students in touch with their respective teachers. When a teacher make a post in a particular course, only enrolled students in this course will be able to see this post.Teacher will not have to inform any announcement to each student separately. Students will get every announcement/notices from OCA automatically when a teacher posts.
